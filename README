The sparkplug project is a demonstration of a simple multithreaded piece of audio software composed of two separate projects. It has a DSP and UI thread, and can be used to do any kind of audio processing on- and off-line

Engine is a DSP processor. It runs on its own non-locking thread and allows for arbitrary audio processing (which will be developed later)

SparkPlug is the UI program that will act as a simple standalone host for plugins or DSP demonstrations.
